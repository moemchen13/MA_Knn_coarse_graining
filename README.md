# K-NN Graph Coarse-Graining (Master‚Äôs Thesis Code)  <!-- #TODO: optionally tweak the title -->

> **TL;DR**: Code and experiments from my master‚Äôs thesis *‚ÄúK-Nearest Neighbor graph coarse-graining from the perspective of dimensionality reduction.‚Äù*  
> It studies how shrinking k-NN graphs and condensing their information affect embeddings (e.g., t-SNE), and highlights links between HSNE and spectral **Kron reduction**, with ties to clustering.

## Overview

This repository accompanies my master‚Äôs thesis on graph coarse-graining viewed through the lens of dimensionality reduction. The work:

- investigates how compressing a k-NN graph changes low-dimensional embeddings (t-SNE and multiscale variants),
- draws a conceptual connection between **HSNE** (Pezzotti et al.) and **Kron reduction** (Schur complement on Laplacians),
- and discusses how ‚Äúcondensing‚Äù graphs relate to **clustering**.
